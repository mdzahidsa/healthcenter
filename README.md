Open Visual studio 2022
Run the project by double clicking on Health.sln which can be found in Health folder.
  
The user must configure the connection string which can be found in appsettings.json file.

  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "HealthcenterConn": "Data Source=DELL\\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=HealthCenterDB;Integrated Security=true"
  },


Open MS SQL Server Management studio copy the server’s name and paste it at Data source. This must have  ” \\”. Initial Catalog should be your Database name. In this project it is HealthCenterDB.

Create database name HealthCenterDB in the MS SQL Management studio then Run the script .sql file consisting of creation of tables and stored procedures .

Run the project by pressing the START button.
Open the front .html file in visual studio code 
Run the front.html file  Right click and choose Open with live server.
During this process, We encountered a bug called CORS error. This issue was caused due to cross platform hosting. This is issue is fixed  from the backend visual studio 2022.

Services.AddCors
build.WithOrigins("*").AllowAnyMethod().AllowAnyHeader();

This can be done at Program.cs
